CTC Prediction Model
Overview
This project implements a predictive model to estimate the “Calculated CTC” (Cost to Company) for employees based on various input features. The model utilizes regression analysis to provide insights into how different factors influence salary expectations, making it a valuable tool for HR professionals and job seekers.

Features
Data Analysis: Analyze the impact of educational background, previous CTC, job changes, and experience on salary.
Predictive Modeling: Employ regression techniques to predict salary outcomes.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple data input and output retrieval.
Statistical Insights: Detailed regression statistics and significance levels.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Microsoft Excel or any compatible spreadsheet software.
Basic understanding of regression analysis and data handling.
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ctc-prediction-model.git

Open the Excel Project.xlsx file in Excel.
Usage
Input the required data in the designated fields.
Run the regression analysis to obtain the predicted CTC.
Review the output for insights and predictions.
Data Description
The dataset includes the following features:

Tier College 1: Indicator for top-tier college education.
Tier 2 College: Indicator for second-tier college education.
Role Manager: Indicator for managerial roles.
City Type: Type of city (e.g., Metro).
Previous CTC: Previous Cost to Company.
Previous Job Changes: Number of job changes prior.
Graduation Marks: Marks obtained during graduation.
Experience (Months): Total work experience in months.
Results
The model provides a detailed output including:

Regression Statistics: Multiple R, R Square, Adjusted R Square, and Standard Error.
ANOVA Table: Analysis of variance results.
Coefficients: Coefficients for each feature indicating their impact on the predicted CTC.
